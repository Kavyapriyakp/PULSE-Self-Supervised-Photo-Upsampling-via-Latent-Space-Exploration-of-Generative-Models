# PULSE-Self-Supervised-Photo-Upsampling-via-Latent-Space-Exploration-of-Generative-Models
a tool in machine learning called a “generative adversarial network,” or GAN, which are two neural netwoks trained on the same data set of photos. One network comes up with AI-created human faces that mimic the ones it was trained on, while the other takes this output and decides if it is convincing enough to be mistaken for the real thing. The first network gets better and better with experience, until the second network can’t tell the difference. Traditional approaches take a low-resolution image and ‘guess’ what extra pixels are needed by trying to get them to match, on average, with corresponding pixels in high-resolution images the computer has seen before. As a result of this averaging, textured areas in hair and skin that might not line up perfectly from one pixel to the next end up looking fuzzy and indistinct. https://today.duke.edu/2020/06/artificial-intelligence-makes-blurry-faces-look-more-60-times-sharper
